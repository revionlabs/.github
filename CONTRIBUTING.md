# Contributing to Revion Labs

This repository is part of the Revion Labs ecosystem.  
We aim for clear, predictable changes and minimal noise.

## How We Work

- Small, focused pull requests
- Explicit changes over hidden behavior
- No drive-by refactors without a clear reason

## Development

- Use TypeScript where possible
- Keep logic deterministic and explainable
- Avoid introducing heavy dependencies
- Follow the existing folder and module structure

## Pull Requests

- Open an issue first for non-trivial changes
- Describe the motivation and impact
- Include how you tested the change
- Keep PR descriptions factual and concise

## Issue Reports

- Provide steps to reproduce
- Include environment details
- Focus on behavior, not speculation
