# Revion Labs

Revion Labs builds a real-world operating system designed to give individuals clarity, structure, and contextual awareness in how they operate their day. We focus on engineering clean, deterministic systems that turn daily signals into actionable understanding.

---

## What We Build
- A unified personal operating system  
- Client-side context engine (browser-based computation)  
- Deterministic scoring models for readiness, capacity, and stress  
- Minimal backend surface  
- Optional Solana-based proof layer (non-transferable badges)

---

## Engineering Principles
- Privacy-first, client-first architecture  
- Explicit logic over hidden behavior  
- Minimal dependencies and predictable boundaries  
- Deterministic, inspectable internal state  
- Systems built to be understood, not guessed

---

## Technical Stack
- TypeScript  
- React / Next.js  
- Lightweight backend services  
- Solana Web3 (optional)
